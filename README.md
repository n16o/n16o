🙋‍♂️ I'm Nathan!

😁 I'm an investor at TechNexus in Chicago right now. I was a founder in Memphis before that!

🗣️ At TechNexus, we invest in things that are relevant to a handful of corporate partners. You'd be surprised by what is relevant, so tell me about anything you're building. nathan [at] technexus [dot] com or 7o3 85one 7two95.

🤍 Personally, I cover defense and industrial tech ecosystems. From frontier tech we'll need in 20 years, to the tech warfighters and workers needed yesterday, to the things that make their families better off. Not enough investors go further than that first bit.

📚 I'm learning to code, mainly to try and understand the founders I work with better. Building things I can use would be neat too.
